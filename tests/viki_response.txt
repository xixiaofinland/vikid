Growing up in a poor family, she spends her days at school and her free time working at a local flower shop with her best friend Kaning (Chanikarn Tangkabodee). But her average life takes an unbelievable turn when she passes the entrance exam to one of the most prestigious high schools in the country.\n\nSeeing Gorya’s acceptance to this new school as a way to escape their poverty, her family is more than a little excited about this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Gorya, on the other hand, isn’t as thrilled by the change in schools, especially not after she meets the school’s most notorious group of seniors. Sons of the country's richest families, the F4: Thyme (Vachirawit Chivaaree), Ren (Jirawat Sutivanichsak), Kavin (Metawin Opas-iamkajorn), and MJ (Hirunkit Changkham), might be blessed with amazing looks and incredible influence, but they’re also the school’s biggest bullies. Handing out “red cards” to anyone they don’t like, they have no qualms about making life miserable for their classmates and as such, Gorya despises them.\n\nStanding up to F4 and their bullying, Gorya refuses to back down, earning her instant respect from Ren, Kavin, and MJ, but it’s Thyme’s unwanted attention that makes Gorya’s life miserable. Despite developing a crush on Ren, Thyme’s pursuit of Gorya continues, never once believing that he won’t eventually win her heart. With time and a healthy amount of character growth, will Thyme eventually win Gorya’s heart?\n\nAdapted from the Japanese manga series “Hana Yori Dango” by Yoko Kamio, “F4 Thailand: Boys Over Flowers” is a 2021 Thai romance drama directed by Patha Thongpan."},"distributors":[{"from":"2021-12-18","name":"GMM 25","to":"2022-04-09","type":"broadcaster"}],"download":{"content_enabled":true,"enabled":true},"episodes":{"count":16,"url":{"api":"https://api.viki.io/v4/series/39527c/episodes.json"}},"flags":{"adult":false,"exclusive":false,"hosted":true,"licensed":true,"on_air":false,"original":false,"private_watch_party":true,"state":"normal"},"genres":["1068g","18g","9g"],"id":"39527c","images":{"latest_video":{"poster":{"source":"viki","url":"https://1.vikiplatform.com/v/1233224v/2249d62266.jpg?x=b"}},"poster":{"source":"viki","url":"https://1.vikiplatform.com/c/39527c/7f4f43f221.jpg?x=b\u0026a=0x0"}},"managers":[{"id":"12966031u","images":{"avatar":{"url":null}},"url":{"api":"https://api.viki.io/v4/users/12966031u.json","web":"https://www.viki.com/users/damiechan"},"username":"damiechan"},{"id":"62725684u","images":{"avatar":{"url":null}},"url":{"api":"https://api.viki.io/v4/users/62725684u.json","web":"https://www.viki.com/users/accalia_"},"username":"accalia_"}],"origin":{"country":"th","language":"th"},"paywallable":{"svod":false,"tvod":false},"planned_episodes":16,"rating":"15","review_stats":{"average_rating":9.57,"count":39616},"subscriptions":{"count":9962},"subtitle_completions":{"cs":99,"da":99,"de":99,"el":99,"en":100,"es":95,"et":96,"fr":100,"hi":97,"hu":100,"it":99,"nl":99,"pl":100,"pt":97,"ro":99},"subtype":"normal","team":{"id":null,"name":null},"titles":{"en":"F4 Thailand: Boys Over Flowers"},"titles_aka":{"en":[]},"titles_phonetic":{"en":""},"trailers":{"count":1,"url":{"api":"https://api.viki.io/v4/series/39527c/trailers.json"}},"type":"series","updated_at":"2023-07-18T09:00:00Z","url":{"api":"https://api.viki.io/v4/series/39527c.json","fb":"https://www.viki.com/tv/39527c-f4-thailand-boys-over-flowers","web":"https://www.viki.com/tv/39527c-f4-thailand-boys-over-flowers"},"watch_now":{"episode":1,"id":"1218950v","type":"episode","url":{"api":"https://api.viki.io/v4/videos/1218950v.json","web":"https://www.viki.com/videos/1218950v-f4-thailand-boys-over-flowers-episode-1"}}}]}
