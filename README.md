# Vikid Cli

I want to know what TV in viki.com have finnish subtitles, but I trust more the rating from douban.com.

Therefore, this is a Cli to retrieve Finnish language subtitled TV Series info from viki and wmda (which has doban info).

# Fetched data

In case you only need the data, here is collected info (updated: 11.2023):
- [csv from viki and wmda(with douban info)](./result2.csv)
- [csv from viki only](./result.csv)

In case you want to install vikid and fetch data by yourself, read further:

# Install

`cargo install vikid`

# How to use it

Run `vikid` without any parameter will fetch info from viki and wmda in
sequence, then save the result into the corresponding csv files.

```
Usage: vikid [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -d, --douban   Retrieve also douban info(id and rating) from wmda
  -v, --viki     Retrieve only basic info from viki
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

# A node version

There is also a node verison of this tool. It only fetch from viki without wmda feature.
